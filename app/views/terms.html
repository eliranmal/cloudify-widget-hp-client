The Service allows you to preview and test certain applications made available on the Service (each, an “Application”) for a period of sixty (60) minutes each (an "Application Preview" and the "Application Preview Term", respectively). You acknowledge that any data you enter into the Service, and any changes made to the Service by or for you during an Application Preview will be permanently lost at the expiration of the Application Preview Term unless you, in your discretion and at your sole risk, responsibility and cost, export or save that data before such expiration. At any time during or following an Application Preview, you may elect to commence an Application Trial as described below.

        1.1.2.	Application Trial. The Service allows you to test and evaluate the Applications, one Application at a time, on a single virtual server, for a period of thirty (30) days each (the "Application Trial" and the "Application Trial Term", respectively), as further described herein. You acknowledge that if you attempt to commence an Application Trial before the expiration of the Application Trial Term of another Application Trial (i.e., attempt to switch from one Application Trial to another), the earlier Application Trial Term will terminate before commencement of the new Application Trial. You further acknowledge that any data you enter into the Service, and any changes made to the Service by or for you, during an Application Trial will be permanently lost at the expiration or termination of the Application Trial Term unless you, in your discretion and at your sole risk, responsibility and cost, export or save that data before such expiration or termination.<br>
